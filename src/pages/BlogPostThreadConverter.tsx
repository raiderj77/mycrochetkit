      { question: 'How does crochet thread sizing work?', answer: 'Crochet thread uses an inverse numbering system — higher numbers mean thinner thread. Size 3 is the thickest common crochet thread. Size 10 is the most popular all-purpose thread. Size 20-30 is fine thread for doilies. Size 80-100 is ultra-fine for heirloom tatting.' },
      { question: 'What size crochet thread should a beginner use?', answer: 'Size 10 crochet thread is the best starting point. It is thick enough to see your stitches clearly, works with a size 7 (1.65mm) steel hook, and is widely available in many colors.' },
      { question: 'What is the difference between tex and denier thread measurements?', answer: 'Tex measures the weight in grams of 1,000 meters of thread. Denier measures the weight in grams of 9,000 meters. Both are direct numbering systems (higher = thicker), unlike the inverse crochet thread numbering. To convert: denier = tex x 9.' },
      { question: 'Can I substitute one thread size for another?', answer: 'Yes, but it changes the finished size of your project. Going from size 10 to size 20 thread roughly halves the finished dimensions. Adjust your hook size accordingly and always make a gauge swatch when substituting.' },

    <p>
      Thread crochet has its own sizing system, and it's backwards from everything else in yarn craft &mdash; higher numbers mean <em>thinner</em> thread. Size 3 is thick, size 10 is medium, size 30 is fine, and size 100 is practically invisible. If you're coming from regular yarn crochet or trying to follow a vintage pattern, the numbering can be genuinely confusing.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Crochet Thread Sizes Explained</h2>
    <p>
      The crochet thread numbering system descends from cotton thread manufacturing, where the number originally represented how many hanks of a standard length could be spun from one pound of cotton. More hanks = thinner thread = higher number. This is why it runs opposite to what feels intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Size 3</strong> (also called "crochet cotton" or "fashion thread") is the thickest crochet thread, similar in weight to a light fingering yarn. It works with a 2.25mm hook and is used for quick-working home decor and accessories. <strong>Size 5</strong> ("pearl cotton") is a bit finer, great for dishcloths and light doilies. <strong>Size 10</strong> is the workhorse of thread crochet &mdash; the most patterns are written for size 10, and it's available in the widest color range. <strong>Size 20</strong> produces delicate doilies and fine table linens. <strong>Size 30 and above</strong> enters heirloom territory &mdash; fine lace, tatting, and pieces that take months to complete.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Matching Thread Size to Hook Size</h2>
    <p>
      Thread crochet uses steel hooks, numbered differently from regular aluminum or ergonomic hooks. And confusingly, steel hook numbers are <em>also</em> inverse &mdash; a size 14 steel hook is smaller than a size 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      General pairings: Size 3 thread works with a 2.25mm (US B/1) or steel 0 hook. Size 5 pairs with a 1.9mm or steel 1-2 hook. Size 10 uses a 1.65mm (steel 7) hook. Size 20 takes a 1.25mm (steel 9) or smaller. Size 30 uses a 1.0mm (steel 10-11) hook. The <a href="https://fibertools.app/thread-converter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#E86A58] underline hover:text-[#D35A4A]">thread converter</a> includes recommended hook sizes for each thread weight.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Tex, Denier, and Metric Numbering</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of craft-specific sizing, the textile industry uses standardized measurement systems. <strong>Tex</strong> is the weight in grams of 1,000 meters of thread &mdash; it's a direct system where higher numbers mean thicker thread. Size 10 crochet thread is approximately 25-30 tex. <strong>Denier</strong> is similar but based on 9,000 meters (denier = tex &times; 9). <strong>Metric count (Nm)</strong> is another inverse system measuring how many kilometers of thread weigh one kilogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      When would you actually need these conversions? When buying thread from industrial suppliers, when substituting sewing thread for fine crochet thread, or when following European or Asian patterns that use metric numbering. The converter handles all these translations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Substituting Thread Sizes</h2>
    <p>
      Substituting thread sizes in a pattern is straightforward math but has dramatic effects. Moving from size 10 to size 20 roughly doubles the "resolution" &mdash; your finished piece will be about half the size with much finer detail. Moving from size 10 to size 5 goes the other direction: larger piece, faster work, but less delicate appearance. Always adjust your hook size and make a gauge swatch.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Vintage Pattern Thread Sizes</h2>
    <p>
      If you work from vintage patterns (pre-1980s), you'll encounter thread descriptions that don't match modern labeling. "Mercerized cotton #40" in a 1950s pattern usually corresponds to modern size 30 thread. "Crochet cotton" without a number typically means size 10. "Tatting thread" usually means size 70-80. When in doubt, match the recommended hook size from the vintage pattern &mdash; that's more reliable than the thread number alone.
    </p>
