      { question: 'What is color pooling in crochet?', answer: 'Color pooling is a technique where you use variegated (multi-color) yarn and specific stitch counts to create intentional patterns like argyle, plaid, or diagonal stripes. Instead of random color changes, the colors pool into organized designs.' },
      { question: 'How do I calculate color pooling?', answer: 'Measure the length of each color section in your yarn, determine your gauge (stitches per inch), then calculate how many stitches each color covers per row. Adjust your stitch count so colors align vertically across rows to create patterns.' },
      { question: 'What stitch works best for color pooling?', answer: 'Moss stitch (also called linen stitch or granite stitch) is the most popular for planned pooling because its alternating pattern of single crochet and chain stitches creates clean color transitions. Regular single crochet also works well.' },
      { question: 'Why isn\'t my color pooling working?', answer: 'Common issues include inconsistent tension (which changes stitch width), wrong stitch count for your yarn\'s color repeat, or yarn with irregular color segment lengths. Try adjusting your chain count up or down by 1-2 stitches and check your gauge carefully.' },

      You've seen those stunning argyle blankets on Instagram &mdash; the ones that look impossibly complex but are actually made with a single strand of variegated yarn. That's <strong>planned color pooling</strong>, and it's one of the most satisfying techniques in crochet once you understand the math behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catch? Getting the stitch count right requires some calculation. Our <a href="https://fibertools.app/color-pooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#E86A58] underline hover:text-[#D35A4A]">free color pooling calculator</a> does the math for you &mdash; just measure your yarn's color sections and enter your gauge.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">How Color Pooling Works</h2>
    <p>
      Variegated yarn has repeating color sequences &mdash; maybe 4 inches of blue, 3 inches of green, 4 inches of blue, 3 inches of cream, and then it repeats. Normally these colors appear random in your fabric. But if you match your row width exactly to the yarn's color repeat length, each color lands in the same position row after row, creating vertical stripes, argyle diamonds, or plaid effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key insight: <strong>your stitch count &times; stitch width must equal the total color repeat length</strong> (or a clean fraction/multiple of it). When colors stack precisely, magic happens.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Measuring Your Yarn's Color Repeat</h2>
    <p>
      Before you open any calculator, you need accurate measurements of your yarn's color sections. Unwind about 2-3 yards of yarn and lay it flat without stretching. Use a ruler to measure each color segment from where it starts to where the next color begins. Write down every color and its length in inches. Do this for at least two full repeats &mdash; some yarns have slight variations between repeats, and you want to catch that early.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might measure: Navy (3.5"), White (2"), Burgundy (3.5"), White (2") = 11" total repeat.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Using the Color Pooling Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      Head to the <a href="https://fibertools.app/color-pooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#E86A58] underline hover:text-[#D35A4A]">FiberTools color pooling calculator</a> and enter your color segments and lengths. Then input your gauge &mdash; how many stitches per inch in your chosen stitch pattern. The calculator will show you the ideal chain count and a preview of how colors will arrange in your fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the preview doesn't show clean pooling, try adjusting up or down by one stitch. Sometimes a single stitch makes the difference between random color soup and a gorgeous argyle pattern.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Best Stitches for Color Pooling</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Moss stitch (linen stitch)</strong> is the gold standard for planned pooling. The alternating sc-ch1 pattern creates compact, consistent stitches where color transitions look crisp. It's also forgiving &mdash; small tension variations are less visible than in other stitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Single crochet</strong> works well too, especially for beginners trying pooling for the first time. The stitches are uniform and easy to count. <strong>Thermal stitch</strong> (working into the back loop of the row below) creates a thick, reversible fabric with excellent pooling characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid tall stitches like double crochet for your first pooling project &mdash; the extra height uses more yarn per stitch, making the math trickier and pooling less predictable.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Troubleshooting Common Pooling Problems</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Colors shifting diagonally instead of stacking:</strong> Your stitch count is close but not quite right. Try adding or removing one stitch. Diagonal drift means each row is slightly too wide or too narrow for the color repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pooling works for a few rows then falls apart:</strong> Tension inconsistency is the usual culprit. Crocheters tend to tighten up after the foundation chain. Make a gauge swatch of at least 20 rows before committing to a project, and measure your gauge from the middle rows, not the first few.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Colors pooling but the pattern isn't what you wanted:</strong> The number of colors and their relative lengths determine the pattern type. Two alternating colors of equal length create stripes. Four colors in an ABAB pattern create argyle. Experiment with the <a href="https://fibertools.app/color-pooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#E86A58] underline hover:text-[#D35A4A]">calculator's preview</a> before you start stitching.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Recommended Yarns for Color Pooling</h2>
    <p>
      Not all variegated yarns pool well. You want yarns with <strong>consistent, clearly defined color segments</strong> &mdash; not gradual transitions or random speckles. Caron Simply Soft Stripes, Red Heart Super Saver Stripes, and Premier Yarns Sweet Roll are popular choices with reliable color repeats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pro tip: buy all your yarn from the same dye lot. Even within the same colorway, different dye lots can have slightly different color segment lengths, which will throw off your pooling.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2C1810] mt-10 mb-4">Plan Your Pooling Project</h2>
    <p>
      Ready to try planned pooling? Start with a dishcloth or scarf &mdash; something flat and rectangular where you don't need shaping. Use the <a href="https://fibertools.app/color-pooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#E86A58] underline hover:text-[#D35A4A]">color pooling calculator at FiberTools</a> to find your ideal stitch count, make a generous gauge swatch, and let the yarn do the work. Once you see those colors lock into an argyle pattern for the first time, you'll be hooked &mdash; pun fully intended.
